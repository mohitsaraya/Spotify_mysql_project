    <h1>Music Tracks Dataset Analysis</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project entails a comprehensive analysis of a music tracks dataset using <strong>MySQL Workbench</strong>. The dataset comprises various attributes of tracks across multiple streaming platforms, providing valuable insights into trends and characteristics in the music industry.</p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The primary goal is to extract actionable insights from the dataset by addressing key analytical questions, including track uniqueness, artist diversity, streaming performance, and various musical attributes. The analysis will aid in understanding patterns and trends within the dataset, informing stakeholders in the music industry.</p>
    <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Track Information</strong>: Name, artist, release date</li>
        <li><strong>Musical Attributes</strong>: BPM, key, mode, danceability, energy, acousticness, liveness, speechiness, valence</li>
        <li><strong>Streaming Platform Presence</strong>: Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Shazam</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Analytical Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How many unique tracks are in the dataset?</li>
        <li>What is the total number of artists?</li>
        <li>Count the number of tracks released each year.</li>
        <li>What is the average number of streams per track?</li>
        <li>List all tracks featured in Spotify charts.</li>
        <li>What is the minimum BPM among all tracks?</li>
        <li>Identify the track with the maximum streams.</li>
        <li>Count tracks in major and minor modes.</li>
        <li>What percentage of tracks are in Apple charts?</li>
        <li>How many tracks have an acousticness percentage greater than 50%?</li>
        <li>Count tracks released in each month.</li>
        <li>Find the track with the highest danceability percentage.</li>
        <li>List tracks with a valence percentage greater than 70%.</li>
        <li>What is the most common key among tracks?</li>
        <li>Find the average energy percentage for tracks in Deezer charts.</li>
        <li>Count the number of tracks in Shazam charts.</li>
        <li>Identify the track with the lowest liveness percentage.</li>
        <li>What is the median speechiness percentage?</li>
        <li>Count tracks in Spotify playlists but not in Apple playlists.</li>
        <li>Find the most frequent release day of the week.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>Each question is addressed using structured query language (SQL) within MySQL Workbench, leveraging relational database operations to extract, manipulate, and analyze the dataset efficiently.</p>
    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>MySQL Workbench</strong>: For executing SQL queries and managing the database.</li>
        <li><strong>SQL</strong>: Primary language for data extraction and analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To replicate the analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Load the dataset into MySQL Workbench.</li>
        <li>Execute the provided SQL queries to answer each analytical question.</li>
        <li>Review the results and visualizations to derive insights.</li>
    </ul>
